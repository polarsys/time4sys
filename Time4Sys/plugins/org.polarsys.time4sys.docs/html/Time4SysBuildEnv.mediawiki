= Time4Sys Build Environment =            

As of 27th April 2018, Time4Sys is based on Eclipse Neon and Sirius 5.1.
For more details on the specific requirements, it is best to look at the m2e target file <code>./Time4Sys/releng/org.polarsys.time4sys.p2/Time4Sys_Neon.target</code>.

== Source ==

The source code is available on github under the polarsys repository: https://github.com/polarsys/time4sys/

The <code>master</code> branch is the one validated by the Eclipse IP team, while the <code>develop</code> branch
is the one you should push your request against.

In a nutshell, you shall run following command to retrieve the source code:

<code>
git clone --branch develop git@github.com:polarsys/time4sys.git
</code>


== Local build ==

The build update-site and product build has been automated. It requires [https://maven.apache.org/ Maven 3].

 <code>
 cd ./Time4Sys/releng/org.polarsys.time4sys.aggregator/
 mvn3 install
 </code>


The artifacts will then be available at following path:
<code>./Time4Sys/releng/org.polarsys.time4sys.product/target/</code>


== CI/CD ==

Once push to the master repository, a continuous-build integration is ran under a Jenkins system.
It is accessible at https://hudson.polarsys.org/time4sys/

Moreover, the [https://hudson.polarsys.org/time4sys/job/Time4Sys%20develop/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/Time4Sys/releng/org.polarsys.time4sys.update.site/target/repository/ latest update site] can be downloaded [https://hudson.polarsys.org/time4sys/job/Time4Sys%20develop/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/Time4Sys/releng/org.polarsys.time4sys.update.site/target/*zip*/target.zip there].
