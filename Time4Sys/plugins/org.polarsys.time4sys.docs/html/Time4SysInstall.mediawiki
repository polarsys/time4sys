= Time4Sys Install =            

== Time4Sys Product ==

Time4Sys is available for different platform (Mac, Linux and Windows), and for 32 or 64 bits machine, so you have to carefully chose the one compatible with your platform.
Once the product is downloaded, you need to extract the zip where you want it to be installed.
Time4Sys product requires a Java 1.8 version installed. If it is not your default your default java version, you also have to specify the path of your java 1.8 version in the Time4Sys -> Eclipse -> eclipse.ini file as follow:
 -vm
 C:\Java\JDK\1.8\bin\javaw.exe

== Update Site ==

Time4Sys can also be installed as an update site. It requires an eclipse based environement with a sirius 5 installed. For example, you can install it on a Eclipse Oxygen (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/oxygen3a), on a Capella 1.2.0 (https://www.polarsys.org/capella/download.html), or on a Capella Studio 1.2.0.

For older version, it is also possible to install it but you will surely need to reinstall a sirius 5 environment before.
It is possible that some features can not be installed or raise warning, but sometimes, it is only because of sirius/acceleo minor version changes, so you can still install the rest and test if your installation is valid. However, in those case, I recommand you to keep a copy of your current environment if you are afraid to lose it.

To test your installation:

* Create a new Time4sys project (the activity explorer shall appear):

* Create a new diagram, add any element.

* Select an element in the diagram and see if your Properties view look like that:
