== Bridge with other modeling tools==

Time4Sys can be used as an intermediate platform to simulate the behavior of your model with the analysis tools provided within Time4Sys.
However, specific viewpoints are needed to be able to represent the real time information.

=== Capella ===

Tideal is the viewpoint to design the real time information on your Capella models.
