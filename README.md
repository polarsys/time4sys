Time4Sys
========

Description
-----------

PolarSys Time4Sys provides a framework that fills the gap between the capture of timing aspects in the design phase of a real-time system and the ability of specific/dedicated tools to verify the consistency and performances of a given scheduling.

It also integrates well in the Capella Tools.
